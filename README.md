# Scripts
Scripts to make my life easier and do things quicker... 
Just a collection of simple scripts that i have written to make every day things i do a little simpler, and quicker. 
I am not the best coder/scripter in the world, but try my best. There may be a better way of doing some of these tasks, 
but this is the way they are and if they are on here, they work for me. If you can adapt them for your use, go ahead. :).
And if there is a glitch in my code somewhere, feel free to fix it.. most of my testing will be done on MacOS and Ubuntu 14.04
for now.
